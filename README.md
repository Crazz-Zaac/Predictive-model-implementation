# Linear predictive model implementation
This is another module after hypothesis testing. Here, I used machine learning techniques to predict the dependent variable(i.e., price). For this part of my practise I used the following two predictive models.
- [x] Simple Linear Regression
- [x] Mulitple Linear Regression

These models were implemented on dataset containing house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

## Tasks included
Following tasks related to hypothesis testing and data visualization were done:
- [x] Testing which features are perfectly negatively or positively correlated with the price of house

- [x] Data visualization
    - [x] Visualization of House price vs Square feet of house

    - [x] Visualization of House price vs House age

    - [x] Visualization of House price vs House floors

    - [x] Scatter plot of x and y test dataset

    - [x] Visualization of actual and predicted value

## Datasets
You can find the datasets used in this project inside the ``` datasets``` directory. The datasets include
1. kc_house_data.csv
2. house_data_preprocessed.csv

The second dataset is prepared from the first dataset including only the columns that we are interested to analyze.


## Installation
You can clone the repository and practise for yourself.
